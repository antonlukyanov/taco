# Table Converter

Why? It is quite often when you need to send somewhere or show someone, for example, your list of
publications. And each time it may be required in different format: pdf, html, docx etc. It is
highly unlikely that somebody keeps such tables in all formats because manual converting is tedious
and difficult: imagine that you have to add many records to such a table - it will take a lot of
time to add it to all files. Also if you need to sort your table or reorder columns, you will have
to spend a lot of time reordering and sorting it by hand (especially, if it is in latex or txt). 

Main features:
- Tables are stored in YAML, so it is easy to read, edit and store them under repository.
- Tables are easily exported to pdf, docx or txt formats.
- Tables can be automatically sorted by specified columns when exporting.
- It is possible to create custom templates.
